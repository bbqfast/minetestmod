	"\\\nwhich are connected to the one used. But the\\\npalantir cannot " ..
	"simply be used. An object of such\\\npower as this cannot be held in " ..
	"place by normal\\\nmaterials, not even for an instant. Indeed, an object" ..
	"\\\nof this power requires some of the most costly\\\nmaterials known to " ..
	"the world in order to hold it in place.\\\n\\\nSo that it can anchor itself " ..
	"to the world, the planatiri\\\nmust have, no further than two meters from it, " ..
	"a\\\nminimum of six tilkal blocks alongside at least 16\\\nmithril blocks. " ..
	"If and only if, these blocks are near\\\nthe palantir, will the palantir be " ..
	"able to be placed,\\\nand it will be anchored to the world. " ..
	"\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\nThere are several ways in which " ..
	"it is possible to\\\nhave the required number of blocks in the required\\\n" ..
	"distance. One example is here given.\\\n\\\nWith mithril blocks represented " ..
	"by M, tilkal blocks\\\nrepresented by T and any other block (including\\\nair) " ..

	"\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\nAfter the palantir has been anchored firmly to the\\\nworld, " ..
	"it needs to be configured before it can be\\\nused. For a start the palantir " ..
	"needs to be assigned\\\nto a network, so that it can connect with other\\\n" ..
	"palantiri. Then the palantir needs to be assigned a\\\nname of its own, so " ..
	"that it can be differentiated\\\nfrom other palantiri. The palantir will not " ..
	"allow you\\\nto proceed if the name you try to give it is the same\\\nas another " ..
	"palantir on the network, or if the\\\nnetwork belongs to someone else. \\\n\\\n" ..
	"Next the palantir will allow you to chose which\\\nraces may use its network. " ..
	"You will be able to\\\nchange your preferences as to which races are\\\nallowed " ..
	"to use the network whenever you add a\\\nnew palantir to the network. If you want " ..
	"nobody\\\nexcept for yourself to be able to use the network,\\\nthen deselect all " ..
	"races.\\\n\\\nAfter this, the palantir is ready to be used. Select\\\nanother " ..
	"palantir on the network to teleport to, and\\\naway you go! If somebody from a " ..
	"race not allowed\\\nto use the palantir tries to use it, there will be\\\n" ..
	"unpleasant consequences for that person...!\\\n\\\nAfter adding another palantir " ..
	"to the network, to be\\\nable to teleport to it from other palantiri, you will" ..
